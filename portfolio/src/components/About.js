<h3>A Brief History</h3>
<p>I studied Graphic Design at Drake University and received my BFA in 2007. I started right away as a Pre-press Designer for a small printing company in Des Moines, IA. After my 2nd design job, I had learned that fixing other people's digital art and documents wasn't helping me grow. I also learned that "art-on-demand" wasn't something I was able to keep up with and enjoy. 2 years into the journey, I move from Iowa back home to Kansas. An indirect path from a Graphic Design degree to selling insurance and then participating in a hack-a-thon at a previous employer's event, I caught the coding "bug". I've worked as an IT business partner for many years, a subject matter expert (SME) for many projects including robotic process automation (RPA). I've finally decided being a partner and SME on the business side isn't enough. I want to be solving the problems and helping business teams come up with the solutions they haven't considered yet.</p>
