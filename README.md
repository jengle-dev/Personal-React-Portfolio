### Stylesheets & Logos
I designed my logo with the input of my friend Blake and my Dad.

* `index.css` is a global stylesheet that is loaded into the main HTML file of your application (index.html). This file is meant for defining styles that will apply to the entire application, regardless of which component or page is being rendered. It is typically used to define base styles for HTML elements like body, html, and a, as well as global styles like colors, typography, and layout.
*  `App.css` is a local stylesheet that is specific to the App component of your React application. It is used to define styles that apply only to the App component and its child components. This file is imported directly into the App component and its styles are scoped to that component's DOM hierarchy.
